# chaos-jetzt nixfiles

NixOS configuration for the [chaos.jetzt] project. They are very much work in progress

## (Migration) TODOs

- [mumble-web](https://github.com/johni0702/mumble-web), possibly adding [mumble-web-proxy](https://github.com/johni0702/mumble-web-proxy/) on top
  - Both need to be packaged for Nix
- [Dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki)
  - Migrate away from SSO
- [freescout-helpdesk](https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk)
  - @e1mo is already working on a nix package + NixOS module for their private nixfiles
  - Migrate away from SSO
  - Data migration
- [Matrix synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) + [element-web](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web)
  - Data migration (synapse)
  - Migrate away from SSO (synapse)
- [maubot github](https://github.com/maubot/github)
  - Not packaged for nix
  - Ditch it?

## Development setup

These nixfiles are built using nix flakes. See [here][nix-install] for nix installation instructions and the [nixos.wiki page on flakes][nix-flakes]. [colmena] is used for deployment, secret management is done using the [sops] based [sops-nix].
The later two (colmena and sops) are available via a `devShell`, defined in the flake, which can be invoked using `nix develop`. [nix-direnv] can also be used in order to automatically create the respective shell upon entering these nixfiles.

## Deployment

[colmena] is used for deployment:

```bash
# Build all hosts
colmena build
# Build specific host(s)
colmena build --on host-a,host-b

# Deploy all hosts in test mode (activate config but do not add it to the bootloader menu)
colmena apply test

# Deploy specific host (actiavte config and use it at the next boot (switch goal))
colmena apply --on host-a

# A VM of the host can be built using plain nix build

nix build .\#nixosConfigurations.host-a.config.system.build.vmWithBootLoader
```

**Note on VMs**: Since the secrets are decrypted for each servers ssh key, the secrets setup will fail.

## Secrets

Secrets are managed using [sops-nix] which is based on [sops]. All secrets are stored in the `secrets/` folder. The `.sops.yaml` configuration file contains information on who has (a) access to keys and (b) which servers can decrypt which keys.

A servers private key can be derived from it's ssh key using [ssh-to-age], generated during initial installation:

```bash
# Only ed25519 keys can be converted using ssh-to-age
ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 shirley.net.chaos.jetzt | nix shell nixpkgs#ssh-to-age -c ssh-to-age
# Or from the host (using legacy nix-shell)
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub | nix-shell -p ssh-to-age --run ssh-to-age
```

When users or servers get added or removed, the secret files need to be updated using `sops updatekeys`. Since this can not be called on all files, `find secrets -type f -exec sops updatekeys {} \;` may be used for convenience.
